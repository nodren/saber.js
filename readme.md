# saber.js

Saber is a collection of well written open source libraries that stand out great on their own, with only a small amount of code, these libraries can be put together to create a great full framework.

# Getting started

You can be up and running with a few easy steps:

1. Install node 6, either the official package, or if you need to handle more than one version of node, check out [n](https://github.com/tj/n)
2. Install babel-cli ```npm install -G babel-cli```
3. install dependencies ```npm install```
4. Setup config.  create a file called ".saberrc" in this folder, copy the defaults from defaults.saberrc, change as necessary
5. MySQL.  There's a ton of ways to do this, regardless of platform MySQL can be downloaded directly from their website and installed easily.  Mac users can also use brew, windows users can use xampp or some other lamp stack setup tool.  I recommend the official mysql approach as it's the easiest all around to get started.
6. Boot up the server, simply type ```npm start```
