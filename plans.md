#Plans

1. show "recommended" organization for frontend, but require absolutely none of it
2. have some simple boilerplate code in root of project that can be easily changed to modify starting jsx component of application.
3. automatic API for models, json/rest.  session, or oauth2 based.
4. differentiate between frontend and backend code.
5. form validation, reports to frontend
6. i18n
7. localization
8. configuration
9. csrf
10. allow alternatives to sequelize for model layer, but only support this day 1
11. have simple file in root of project that lets you stitch in different model layer and change structure of frontend, or change api out
12. keep the door open for a react native frontend to a oauth2 protected backend, possibly as another package
13. webpack/hot reloading
